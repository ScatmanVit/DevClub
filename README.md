A dark-themed landing page built from scratch with pure HTML and CSS. No frameworks, no JavaScript — just markup and styling.

The focus was on layout techniques and visual polish: CSS Grid for the benefits section, Flexbox for the tech pills, gradient text, animated borders on hover, and a responsive structure that holds up across screen sizes.

## What I practiced

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Gradient text with `background-clip`
- Hover animations with `::before` pseudo-elements
- Responsive design without media query overload
